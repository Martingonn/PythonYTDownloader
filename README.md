# How to use
1. Download the files from the release you need.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.5 and up, or you will have to adapt the libraries manually.
4. Download required dependencies from the "required.txt" file using "pip install -r required.txt"
5. Run the script, follow instructions in terminal.
   If Python tells you that you don't have required libraries installed even though you do, try running the script with "python" instead of "python3". Example: instead of "python3 PYTverB10.py" do "python PYTverB10"
